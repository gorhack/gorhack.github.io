Hello! Thank you for visiting. I am Kyle Gorak and I am a 22 year old programmer and technology enthusiast. In 2010 I co-founded PRNDL Development Studio with <a href="http://davidbenko.me">David Benko</a> and developed several iPhone, Android, and Windows Phone applications along with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cyaglenski">Christian Yaglenski</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=156808511">Matthew Hogan</a>. We developed <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/securis/id392732678?mt=8">Securis</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.prndl.bombdefuse&hl=en">Bomb Defuse</a>, and other applications and websites. Shortly thereafter I enrolled in West Point where I am currently enrolled and studying Computer Science. I will branch Finance, branch-detail Field Artillery, in May 2016.
