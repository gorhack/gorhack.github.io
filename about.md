<p class="message">

Hello! Thank you for visiting my site. In 2010 I co-founded PRNDL Development Studio with <a href="http://davidbenko.me">David Benko</a>
and developed several iPhone, Android, and Windows Phone applications along with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cyaglenski">Christian Yaglenski</a>
and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=156808511">Matthew Hogan</a>. We developed a secure account manager, Securis, for
iOS, Android, and web, a native cross-platform game on iOS, Android, and Windows Phone, Bomb Defuse, and other miscellaneous
applications and websites. I graduated from the United States Military Academy with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.

I am currently working on personal projects in my free time. Feel free to contact me with any comments or questions!
