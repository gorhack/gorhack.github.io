# Credit Card Recommendations for Military Service Members

The audience for this is active duty military service members. Although many recommendations have nothing to do with
military service, I would not recommend several of the below credit cards if the annual fee was not waived. I will
attempt to keep this strictly about credit cards, however, some credit cards do require establishing a banking
relationship as well.

**If you have poor financial responsibility and would ever charge an amount to a credit card without the ability
to pay off the credit card in full by its due date, do not apply for or use credit cards.** 


## Before applying to a new credit card:

1) Ask your coworkers for a referral; typically you both will benefit from a referral. There are **no** referral links
   in this post. I only highlight primary category benefits of each card. Benefits are all subject to change. 

2) Be cognisant of credit inquiries, credit card company
   [application restrictions](https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/credit-card-application-restrictions/), and timeline
   to achieve minimum spend bonus offers. You will not be able to apply for a high number of credit cards in a short
   time.

3) Understand the credit card's benefits and have a plan for how you will use the credit card.

4) Know which companies [waive annual fees](https://militarymoneymanual.com/credit-cards-waive-annual-fees-military/)
   for military.

   - American Express
   - Chase
   - Citi
   - U.S. Bank


# Maximizing Cashback and Points

## Getting Started with an "Everything" Card

At the very least, you should be getting a *minimum* of 2% cashback on all purchases with your credit card. There are many
ways to earn higher than 2%, but many require additional steps. For example, with the
[Bank of America Unlimited Cash Rewards](https://www.bankofamerica.com/credit-cards/products/unlimited-cash-back-credit-card/),
you earn 1.5% at baseline, however, if you have \$100,000 in a Merrill Lynch brokerage account you can earn a 75%
bonus through [Preferred Rewards](https://promotions.bankofamerica.com/preferredrewards/en) resulting in 2.62% cashback
on all purchases. Similarly, the [U.S Bank Smartly Visa Signature](https://www.usbank.com/credit-cards/bank-smartly-visa-signature-credit-card.html) offers to 4% cashback on everything with \$100,000 in a U.S Bank Brokerage/Savings account. The new [Robinhood Gold Card](https://robinhood.com/creditcard/) earns 3% cashback on all purchases,
but requires a RobinHood Gold subscription (\$5/mo or $50/yr). Below are a couple recommended "no-hoops" 2% cashback credit cards.

# Credit Card Rumors:

1) You should **never** carry a balance on your credit cards, it is not a way to improve your credit score.

2) Having many credit cards does not mean you will have poor credit (the *number of open accounts* is a small factor
   relative to others when your credit score is calculated. *Credit inquiries* are a predominately temporary impact to
   your credit score. If you are anticipating taking out a loan, especially a mortgage, you should avoid necessary
   credit inquiries for several months prior to applying). I have nearly 30 active credit cards and over an 800
   credit score across each credit bureaus.

3) Paying with a credit card is *always* safer than paying with cash or a debit card due to the liability and
   fraud protection available.

4) Even with some places charging more for credit compared to cash or debit, you can still "out-earn" the fee with some
   credit cards. For example, if a restaurant charges 2.5% for credit card users, but your credit card earns 4%
   cashback, you will still net 1.5% cashback by using your credit card.

5) You can have multiple of the same credit card to maximize its perks. Sometimes this requires upgrading from a lower
   tier card, sometimes you can apply through a co-branded credit card.

*Drawer card means I only charge purchases to them for the benefit (and they typically stay in my drawer).

Personally, I value cash back over points because I can immediately treat them as monthly "rebates" on purchases. Even
though you can redeem points for more than 1¢/ea, I generally value all points at 1¢ each because they typically require
"saving" points over months or years to achieve higher redemption values (except PenFed which are valued at .75-85¢ each
because redemption options are so poor) through transfer or travel portals. **I pay \$0 in annual fees for all of my
credit cards.**


## Next cards I'll be applying for:

1) [Robinhood Gold Card](https://robinhood.com/creditcard/), 3% cashback on everything
2) [US Bank Smartly](https://www.usbank.com/credit-cards/bank-smartly-visa-signature-credit-card.html), up to 4% cash ack on everything
